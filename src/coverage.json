        "summary": "Fix the bug where, after the last remaining card is moved out of a tableau column (e.g., the first tableau pile that started as a single card) into a foundation pile, the now-empty tableau space is not usable as a drop target to start a new descending stack. Empty tableau columns must continue to render a visible drop zone and accept valid drag-and-drop moves (e.g., dropping a King or King-led run) according to existing Klondike rules.",
