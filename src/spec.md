# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the Solitaire page header title to “Simple Solitaire” and center the card layout across screen sizes.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the main Solitaire page header title text to read exactly "Simple Solitaire" while leaving all other user-facing text unchanged.
- Adjust layout styling to horizontally center the top row (stock/waste/foundations) and the tableau row across responsive breakpoints without introducing horizontal overflow or breaking drag-and-drop.

**User-visible outcome:** The Solitaire page shows the title “Simple Solitaire”, and the cards/piles are visually centered on desktop and mobile while gameplay interactions continue to work normally.
