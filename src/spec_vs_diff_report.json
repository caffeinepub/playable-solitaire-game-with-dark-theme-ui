  "summary": "The diff evidence is insufficient to verify that the requested header title rename and layout centering were actually implemented in code (the key UI portions of SolitairePage.tsx are truncated). The diff does show updates to project_state.json and a broad frontend-file-summaries.txt change that were not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the top header title on the Solitaire page to read exactly \"Simple Solitaire\" and leave all other existing text unchanged.",
      "reason": "The provided SolitairePage.tsx diff is truncated before any header/title JSX is shown, so there is no direct evidence in the diff that the visible header title string was updated, nor that no other user-facing strings changed.",

      "requirement": "Center the card layout (top row: stock/waste/foundations; and tableau row) horizontally within the page across responsive breakpoints, without breaking drag-and-drop interactions or causing horizontal overflow.",
      "reason": "The SolitairePage.tsx diff excerpt does not include any layout/container JSX or styling changes demonstrating horizontal centering, wrapping behavior, or overflow prevention; therefore implementation cannot be verified from the diff summary.",
