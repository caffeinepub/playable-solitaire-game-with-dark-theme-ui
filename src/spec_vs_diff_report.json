  "summary": "The BuildRequest requires a frontend fix ensuring empty tableau columns remain visible and act as valid drag-and-drop targets after the last card is moved out (e.g., to foundation). The provided diff evidence only shows modifications to SolitairePage.tsx (truncated) plus metadata/summaries; there is no concrete diff evidence of updated tableau empty-slot rendering and drop handling logic, which is typically in the pile rendering/drag-drop component.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-42",
      "requirement": "After the last remaining card is moved out of a tableau column into a foundation pile, the empty tableau space must still render a visible drop zone and accept valid drag-and-drop moves (King/King-led run) while rejecting invalid drops (non-King) with normal drag-over highlighting.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include any visible code changes showing (1) an always-rendered empty tableau drop zone, (2) drag-over highlighting on that empty zone, or (3) drop validation/handling for empty tableau columns. Only SolitairePage.tsx is modified (and truncated), and no pile-level drag/drop implementation changes are shown.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/solitaire/SolitairePage.tsx (truncated shows no explicit empty-tableau drop-zone logic)",
        "MODIFIED FILES list shows no changes to PileView.tsx (where tableau drop zones/handlers are described to live)"
