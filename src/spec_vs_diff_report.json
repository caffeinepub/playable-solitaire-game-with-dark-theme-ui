  "summary": "The diff adds a client-side playthrough results hook with localStorage persistence and derives best-time and best-moves leaderboards. SolitairePage records exactly one result per won playthrough (guarded by a ref keyed to the game instance) and passes current time/moves plus both leaderboards into an updated WinDialog UI that displays the current result, two ranked lists, and empty states in English.",
