  "summary": "Diff updates the solitaire card component to use stable selectors and ring-based hover/active styles (no transforms), adds defensive global CSS to neutralize reflection/compositing-related properties on cards (and draggable elements), and adjusts Tailwind's `shadow-card` to a conventional box-shadow. Diff also includes additional, non-requested changes to SolitairePage behavior/props and broader theme/token updates beyond card-specific fixes.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Expanded SolitairePage logic unrelated to card reflection fixes (timer/results recording, preferences/new-game dialog flow, typed prop adjustments, additional UI imports).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is strictly about card styling/compositing artifacts and Tailwind shadow token; these gameplay/UI-state changes are not requested and risk scope creep.",

    {
      "description": "Broad global theme/token redesign (extensive OKLCH color system changes for light/dark themes) beyond card-specific artifact mitigation.",
      "reason": "Non-goal states not to redesign the overall page theme beyond what is necessary for the artifact fix; the diff shows large-scale color token changes not clearly limited to the card component.",

    {
      "description": "Defensive CSS applied to all draggable elements globally (`[draggable=\"true\"]`) rather than being limited to card elements/wrappers.",
      "reason": "REQ-3 calls for defenses specifically for the card element and its wrappers and warns against overly broad selectors that could affect non-card UI; the diff adds a global draggable selector that may impact other draggable UI (if any).",
