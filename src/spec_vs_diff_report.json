  "summary": "Diff implements locked foundations by preventing click/selection and drag initiation from foundation piles, rejecting foundation drag payloads at the drag utility layer, and updating the hint system to never suggest moves whose source is a foundation. It also adds a visual locked affordance (lock icon + non-interactive styling) via a new `isLocked` prop on `CardView` (but the provided `PileView.tsx` diff is truncated, so propagation of `isLocked` specifically to foundation top cards cannot be fully verified from the excerpt).",
